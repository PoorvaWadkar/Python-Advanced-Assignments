Operator overloading is achieved by defining special methods in class, often referred to as \"magic methods\" or \"dunder methods\".\n",

    "1.Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Classes are the fundamental building blocks of Python OOP. They define the blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -To comprehend OOP code, we must be able to identify classes and understand their attributes and methods. We should also be able to create objects from classes, access their attributes, and call their methods.\n",

    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "   \n",

    "2.Inheritance and Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Inheritance is a crucial concept in OOP that allows us to create new classes based on existing ones. It promotes code reuse and hierarchy in codebase.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This concept allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior.\n",

    "           self.make = make\n",

    "       def start_engine(self):\n",
    "           pass  # Placeholder for the method\n",

    "       vehicle.start_engine()\n",
