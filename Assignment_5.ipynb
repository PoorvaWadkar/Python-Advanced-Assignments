    "Delegation is a design pattern and a concept in object-oriented programming where one object (the delegate) passes on a specific responsibility or task to another object. Instead of handling the task itself, the delegate assigns it to another object that is better suited to perform the task. Delegation is a way to achieve code reuse and promote modular, maintainable, and loosely coupled code.\n",

    "1.Separation of Concerns: Delegation helps to separate different concerns or responsibilities within a program. Instead of a single object trying to do everything, different objects can handle specific tasks or functionality.\n",
